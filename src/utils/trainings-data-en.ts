Take a step to the side with your right foot until your stance is 3–4 feet wide, or wider than hip width. Wider is OK as long as you can perform the move correctly. Move your hips back slightly and bend your knees as you lower your body into a squat position. Draw your tailbone straight down to the floor. Be mindful to keep your spine neutral, core engaged, and eyes forward throughout the movement. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor. You can go lower or shorten the squat if parallel is too low or if you can’t maintain your leg alignmen. Pause in the squat position for a few seconds. Then, engaging your glutes, press up to standing, driving up through your heels.",
